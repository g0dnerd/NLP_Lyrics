" And shepherds we shall be For thee, my lord, for thee Power hath descended forth from thy hand That our feet may swiftly carry out thy command So, we shall flow river forth to thee And teeming with souls, shall it ever be In nomine patris, et filli Et spiritus sancti You've sunk lower than I've ever seen And even though you deserved this, I tried to catch your fall I've grown so tired of your childish threats Know that I'll never run from anything And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive Here's where we prove all your fairy tales wrong, this all stops Tonight, swim in your sea of smoke, until your lungs lose the fight It's over, this all stops tonight Or prove me wrong What have you become through your jealousy? You've threatened my life, my friends, and family This is your last wrong turn in your life And this dead end leads to a blood bath, your blood bath And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive Here's where we prove all your fairy tales wrong, this all stops Tonight, swim in your sea of smoke, until your lungs lose the fight It's over, this all stops tonight Or prove me wrong ",A Day to Remember

You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil You've been at it for years, but couldn't reach that next level Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see (Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight, outta mind is what you'll always be (Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you I speak the truth and everybody else knows it So set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it Can't waste my time on hateful people like you So keep wishing you were me and I'll keep making you have to (Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight, outta mind is what you'll always be (Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you I just can't believe it's really come to this Because without me, you would not exist (Hey, hey!) Still got something left to say Only one in the world that I depend on is me I need nothing from no one, I take what I need Get a hold of yourself, and keep away from me (Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight, outta mind is what you'll always be (Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you ",A Day to Remember

It looks an awful lot like fear Now, you're so quick to fall on failure And so quick to raise your voice, like 'If I can't find a mistake to blame We didn't have a choice.' Oh, but you had an option I was your chance to feel complete But when I leaned in close to you, you Kissed your fear instead of me You had my hand in your hand You had my lip in your teeth You had my heart on your sleeve You had a chance to breathe But, boy, you wouldn't let your fear recede so I moved on Oh, and it's too late to change your mind now You got scared, boy, and I got gone Now you failed, and there's no way to turn back time You had your chance, boy, I tried.""

" 1978. San Diego. I’d just come out the other side of a relationship that blew up…I was angry, and disillusioned, and ultimately self-destructive. I’d lost everything I believed in …I was as utterly, completely alone as I’ve ever been So I began going on walks I started taking late-night walks around the San Diego suburb I was living in at the time. I’d start walking early evening, and come back close to midnight, sometimes later. Walking and thinking and chewing over what had gone wrong with my life One night, at Fourth and E Streets, I got mugged and beaten by a street gang—sent me to the hospital with serious intimations of mortality. When the ER techs asked what my religion was, I refused to answer. I made my private peace with the universe, content with whatever was going to happen, live or die Then something happened. I got angry. I got angry because I still had stories to tell. So I fought back It took two months to fully recover. But two things came out of that incident. First, I have no fear of death. None whatsoever Second…as soon as I was well enough, I started walking again Sometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning, through parts of town that made even street people nervous When people asked what I was doing out there that late at night, the only answer I could give was, “I’m looking for something.” So I kept walking through some of the most dangerous parts of San Diego, before it got cleaned up, when it was still home to hookers and drunks and gangs and addicts and random violence Finally, one afternoon, I came to the same areas I walked through at night and I was struck by the dichotomy between that corner at night, and the very same corner during the day In the daylight, there were businessmen and kids and clerks, eager to get home to dinner and TV and family Then, later, came the night shift, the lost people, emerging from shadows and beds of pain to walk the same streets in search of fixes, money, and bars, gradually fading away with the dawn Two totally different worlds, sharing nothing but longitude and latitude. There was the nation in the day, and the nation at night, existing side by side but each fleeing the other A daylight nation And a midnight nation I saw a country bifurcated by more than just the presence and absence of light, but by lives cast aside and lost and uncared for; the walked away and the thrown-away on one side, and on the other, those who pretended not to see them, because not seeing is easier And I saw someone forced to walk both sides of the metaphor, to learn that the greatest cruelty is our casual blindness to the despair of others, that there but for the grace of whatever god you subscribe to goes any of us And finally, I realized that I had found what I was looking for, without ever being quite sure what it was I found a story that would make my own life make sense again This story ",La Dispute

Our kids.” Everybody wondering how far they were from where the victims live And I visit them, their houses Inside my dream I visit them My spirit, soaring high and high up over King Park Leaves the crime scene, travels further back Til far before the shooting Through their windows To their living rooms I see them younger this time, playing games and doing homework All these marks of youth soon transformed coldly into stone For fights and stupid feuds For ruins wrapped in gold And cruelly I recall why I have come to find a reason But there cannot be a reason, not for death Not like this, not like this Three days later they made funeral plans, the family Three days later a mother had to bury her son Not far away the shooter holed up in a hotel Near to the highway with a friend and the gun That same gun He'd fled immediately but was identified by witnesses His picture on TV, only 20 years old They called him “Grandpa” He was older than the others by a year Maybe two And he was safe for awhile until somebody saw him there And notified the authorities Who surrounded the hotel, first arresting an accomplice while attempting to flee Then chasing him up the staircase to the floor where he’d stayed He closed the door hard behind him Locked himself in the room They could’ve kicked in the door But knew the gun was still with him One he’d already used and so they feared what he’d do I floated up through the window of a room to the West I hovered out to the hallway, tried to listen in I heard them trying to reason, get him to open the door His uncle begging and pleading, half-collapsed to the floor He preached of hope and forgiveness Said, “There is always a chance to rectify what you’ve taken Make your peace in the world.” I thought to slip through the door, I could’ve entered the room I felt the burden of murder, it shook the earth to the core Felt like the world was collapsing Then we heard him speak “Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself? Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself? Can I ever be forgiven cause I killed that kid? It was an accident I swear it wasn’t meant for him! And if I turn it on me If I even it out Can I still get in or will they send me to hell?

It was a time when romantic relationships took on the character of ice in spring, stranding many little children on jagged and inhospitable floes Nobody quite knew what to make of the moon anymore Consider a certain night in August. The moon was so bloated it was about to tip over. For more than an hour, Leigh-Cheri stared into the sky. ""Does the moon have a purpose?"" She inquired.

" The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black fur. Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, and said, ‘Bother!’ Something up above was calling him So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and then scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, ‘Up we go! Up we go!’ till at last, pop! His snout came out into the sunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow ‘This is fine!’ he said to himself, and, jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the delight of spring, he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting—everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him, he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before—this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver—glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea The mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with a sigh of full contentment, and leaned back blissfully. ‘WHAT a day I’m having!’ he said ",La Dispute

" The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very end of his long effort, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward the lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy. When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, it happens that melancholy arises in man’s heart: this is the rock’s victory. But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged. Thus, Edipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But from the moment he knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment, he realizes that the only bond linking him to the world is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out: “Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well.” “I conclude that all is well,” says Edipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted All Sisyphus’ silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him The rock is still rolling ",La Dispute

It’s energy It’s like medicine It’s self-discovery See, all the secrets I keep, why are they secrets? It’s only temporary, that fleeting feeling of warmth Just a flash before the line gets blurry Between a longing for more than what the body wants now and What the body wants now more than anything Was it integrity that kept my hands to myself or Just the thought of getting too far ahead of you? Was it that I got too tired of the consequence? Or was I just scared? I only know I never wanted to get left behind No pauses, not a second guess First a swaying then a stumble then a swagger They’re just movements towards feeling .

His dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly! He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself! A wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk And laying his finger aside of his nose And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose! He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle And away they all flew like the down of a thistle But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight Happy christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""
